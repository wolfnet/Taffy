# Thanks for checking out Taffy!

Taffy is a ColdFusion framework that helps you build RESTful web services with very little boilerplate code, very little configuration, and to be honest, very little effort.

## Documentation

Documentation is provided via [the wiki][3].

### You can contribute to the documentation

If you would like to contribute to [the wiki][3] documentation, [please read this blog post][2]. If you still have questions, [ask them on our mailing list][1]. :)

## Community

We have [a mailing list for Taffy Users][1]. Feel free to ask for help, discuss potential bugs, and share new ideas there.

## Open Source!

Part of the beauty of open source is that _you can affect change_. You can help improve the documentation, fix a bug, add tests, or even propose new features. Nothing is off limits, and I try to be very responsive to pull requests and on the mailing list.

**What does that mean?**

It means you can use Taffy pretty much any way you like. You can fork it. You can include it in a proprietary product, sell it, and not give us a dime. (Legal, if a bit rude.) Pretty much the only thing you can't do is hold us accountable if anything goes wrong.
